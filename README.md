## My . files

This contains the config files for my terminal setup.

## Environment

I use zshell with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) for my shell. For editing I use [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) with the [Solarized Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme.

## Installation

This script should work, but it's quite brittle. Run `curl https://raw.github.com/Soliah/dotfiles/master/go.rb | ruby`.
