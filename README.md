## My . files

This contains the config files for my terminal setup.

## Environment

I use zsh with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) inside of [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/). I edit with vim terminal vim.

## Installation

This script should work, but it's quite brittle. Run `curl https://raw.github.com/Soliah/dotfiles/master/go.rb | ruby`.
